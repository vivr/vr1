### Musical Intervals

An interval is the distance in pitch between two notes.

### Sharps and flats

- A **sharp (♯)** raises a note by one semitone.
- A **flat (♭)** lowers a note by one semitone.
- A **natural (♮)** cancels a sharp or flat.

Some notes share the same pitch. These are called **enharmonic** (for example, C♯ and D♭).

### Steps

- A **half step** is the smallest distance between notes.
- A **whole step** is two half steps.

### Scale degrees

Notes in a scale are numbered from 1 to 8:

1. Tonic  
2. Supertonic  
3. Mediant  
4. Subdominant  
5. Dominant  
6. Submediant  
7. Leading tone  
8. Tonic (octave)

### Interval names

Intervals are named by counting scale degrees. 

For example:

- C to D = a **second**
- C to E = a **third**
- C to F = a **fourth**

### Major, minor, and perfect intervals

- Seconds, thirds, sixths, and sevenths can be **major** or **minor**.
- Fourths, fifths, and octaves are **perfect** intervals.

### Augmented and diminished

- Raising a perfect or major interval by a semitone makes it **augmented**.
- Lowering a perfect or minor interval by a semitone makes it **diminished**.

### Compound intervals

Any interval larger than an octave is a **compound interval** (for example, a ninth = an octave plus a second).
