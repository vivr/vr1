### Music Track 01 - Happy Hardcore

Following tutorials has been a great way for me to learn music production and I recently tried one by [STRANJAH](https://www.youtube.com/@STRANJAH) called [DnB Producer makes HAPPY HARDCORE...? ðŸ˜ƒ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXtskGVhvtA). It was a really easy to follow tutorial that helped me create something I wouldn't have tried otherwise.

Here's the finished track:
