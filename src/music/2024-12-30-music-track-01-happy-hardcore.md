### Music Track 01 - Happy Hardcore

Following tutorials has been a great way for me to learn music production and I recently tried one by [STRANJAH](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXtskGVhvtA) called _DnB Producer makes HAPPY HARDCORE...? ðŸ˜ƒ_. It was a really easy to follow guide that helped me create something I wouldn't have tried otherwise.

I built the track in **Ableton Live** using vocal samples from [91Vocals Soulful Drum and Bass Vocals](https://91vocals.com/products/soulful-drum-bass-vocals?srsltid=AfmBOoqXxdbTPoAUmrWGOLa_9aSNsb07H2bKaC52vOyvmfSNV3u5aKYm).

Here's the finished track:
