### Introduction

This guide explains the basic steps for mixing a track in Ableton Live. It is based on the ideas shown in Alice Efe’s lesson: [My Mixes Sucked Until I Learnt This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVJthAR-HHg).

### What mixing means

Mixing is the process of balancing all the sounds in your track so they work well together.  

This usually involves:

- adjusting volume  
- EQ to remove unwanted frequencies  
- panning  
- compression  
- adding small effects for clarity  
- creating space so each sound has its own place

Good mixing makes the track sound clean, strong and easy to listen to.

### Step 1: Set your levels

1. Play the full track.  
2. Bring all faders down.  
3. Start with the kick, set it around **–6 dB to –8 dB**.  
4. Add each sound one by one.  
5. Adjust volumes so nothing is too loud or getting lost.

Mixing always starts with volume. If levels are balanced, the rest of the mix becomes much easier. A quiet master output also gives you room to make the track louder later.

### Step 2: Clean up with EQ

Use **EQ Eight** on each track to remove frequencies that are not needed.

**Common clean-ups:**

- Remove low rumble from hats, claps and leads (high-pass around 100–200 Hz).  
- Remove harsh or sharp areas from synths if they stick out.  
- Reduce muddy frequencies around 200–400 Hz if the mix feels heavy.  
- Leave the kick and bass mostly in the low end, but avoid them fighting each other.

Every sound naturally contains frequencies you do not hear clearly but still take up space. Cleaning these removes clutter and makes the mix clearer and brighter.

### Step 3: Give each sound its space

1. Keep low sounds (kick, bass) in the centre.  
2. Place some percussion slightly left or right.  
3. Keep the lead sound near the centre but not too wide.  
4. Use stereo width gently to avoid a messy mix.

If every sound is in the centre, the mix becomes crowded. Small panning changes help each sound feel separate and easier to identify.

### Step 4: Control dynamics with compression

Use compression on:

- the kick and bass (light compression)  
- claps or snares  
- any sound with sharp peaks  

Avoid heavy compression unless you know exactly why you are using it. Compression reduces sudden spikes in volume and keeps sounds more even. This makes the mix smoother and stops loud sounds from jumping out too much.

### Step 5: Add small amounts of reverb and delay

Use reverb on:

- claps  
- leads  
- percussion

Use delay on:

- lead lines  
- effects  
- background elements

Keep the kick and bass almost completely dry. Reverb and delay create space and depth. Small amounts make the mix feel more alive. Too much will make the track muddy, so use it gently.

### Step 6: Check kick and bass balance

1. Solo the kick and bass together.  
2. Make sure they do not clash.  
3. If they do, cut a small amount of low frequency from the bass or adjust the kick’s body.  
4. Consider slight sidechain compression to make space for the kick.

Kick and bass form the foundation of the low end. If these two fight each other, the whole track will feel weak.

### Step 7: Group related tracks

Group similar sounds:

- all drums together  
- all synths together  
- effects together

Add gentle processing to the groups:

- small EQ  
- light compression  
- small amount of saturation (optional)

Grouping lets you control whole sections at once. It keeps your project tidy and makes mixing faster.

### Step 8: Final balance check

1. Listen at a low volume.  
2. Make tiny changes to levels if needed.  
3. Compare your track with a reference track at the same loudness.  
4. Make sure nothing is too sharp or too quiet.

Small adjustments at the end often make the biggest difference. Low-volume listening helps reveal imbalances you may miss at higher levels.
