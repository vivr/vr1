### Musical Scales

A scale is a series of eight consecutive notes within one octave. It begins and ends on the same note, just one octave apart. For instance, every C scale starts on C and ends on C; similarly an F scale begins and ends on F.

Each scale contains six other notes in between. The first note of a scale is called the _tonic_, or first degree. The following notes in the scale are called the second degree, third degree and so on until reaching the eighth note, which is the tonic again. The scale is named after its first (and last) note.

An exception to the eight-note scale rule is the _chromatic scale_, which includes all notes within an octave, including sharps and flats.

### Major Scales

Although every major scale has a unique set of notes, they all follow the same structure. Major scales follow the pattern of intervals: WWHWWWH, which stands for Whole step, Whole step, Half step, Whole step, Whole step, Whole step, Half step.

The names of the eight notes of a major scale are:

1. Tonic (also known as the first degree)
2. Supertonic
3. Mediant
4. Subdominant
5. Dominant
6. Submediant
7. Leading tone (also known as the leading note)
8. Tonic (the octave)

The first and eighth notes, known as the tonic, decide the key of the scale. The other notes in the scale are numbered 2–7, each representing a scale degree.

For instance, in C major (with the notes C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C), if someone asked you to play the fourth and second notes, you'd play F and D. Similarly, if they asked for the subdominant and supertonic, you'd still play F and D.

### Minor Scales

There are three types of minor scales: natural, harmonic, and melodic.

The names of the eight notes in a **natural minor scale** are:

1. Tonic
2. Supertonic
3. Minor mediant
4. Subdominant
5. Dominant
6. Minor submediant
7. Subtonic
8. Tonic

In the harmonic and melodic minor scales, the seventh degree is called the leading tone. In the melodic minor scale, the sixth degree is called the submediant.

Natural minor scales follow the interval pattern of WHWWHWW. That translates into Whole step, Half step, Whole step, Whole step, Half step, Whole step, Whole step, with the first note (and last) in the scale determining the scale name.

A natural minor scale is taken from the major scale of the same name, but with the third, sixth, and seventh degrees lowered one half step.

The **harmonic minor scale** is a type of minor scale that includes a raised seventh degree compared to the natural minor scale. This raised seventh degree creates a unique interval pattern and distinctive sound. In the key of A minor, for example, the harmonic minor scale includes the notes A, B, C, D, E, F, and G♯, with G♯ being the raised seventh degree.

The **melodic minor scale** is another variation of the minor scale, characterised by different ascending and descending patterns. In the ascending form, the sixth and seventh degrees are raised compared to the natural minor scale, while the descending form usually reverts to the natural minor scale. For example, in A melodic minor, the ascending form includes the notes A, B, C, D, E, F♯, and G♯, while the descending form follows the natural minor scale pattern.

### Modes

A musical mode is a type of scale with a distinctive set of intervals between its notes. Each mode starts and ends on a specific note within a major scale, called the tonic, and has a different arrangement of whole and half steps. There are several modes, including Ionian (major), Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolydian, Aeolian (natural minor), and Locrian.

- **Ionian mode**: (same as major scale), Ionian mode starts and ends on the tonic note of a major scale.
- **Dorian mode**: starts on the second note of a major scale.
- **Phrygian mode**: starts on the third note of a major scale.
- **Lydian mode**: starts on the fourth note of a major scale.
- **Mixolydian mode**: starts on the fifth note of a major scale.
- **Aeolian mode** (same as natural minor scale). Starts on the sixth note of the related major scale.
- **Locrian mode** starts on the seventh note of a major scale.
