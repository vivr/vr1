### Chords

A chord is three or more different notes played together.

### Triads

A **triad** has three notes:

- Root  
- Third  
- Fifth  

The third decides if the chord is major or minor.

### Other basic triads

- **Diminished**: minor third + diminished fifth  
- **Augmented**: major third + augmented fifth  

### Seventh chords

A seventh chord adds a fourth note above the triad:

- **Major seventh**: major triad + major seventh  
- **Minor seventh**: minor triad + minor seventh  
- **Dominant seventh**: major triad + minor seventh

### Extended chords

- **Sixth chord**: triad + sixth  
- **Ninth chord**: triad + seventh + ninth  
- **Eleventh chord**: triad + seventh + eleventh

### Altered, suspended, and power chords

- **Altered chords** change one or more notes.  
- **Suspended chords** replace the third with a second (sus2) or fourth (sus4).  
- **Power chords** use only the root and fifth.

### Inversions

An inversion changes which note is at the bottom:

- First inversion: third is lowest  
- Second inversion: fifth is lowest  
- Seventh chords and larger chords have further inversions

### Chord progressions

Chords often follow patterns within a key. The **tonic (I)** is the home chord in major keys. The **V** chord naturally leads back to **I**.

### Chord leading

Some chords move smoothly to others. A common example is **V → I**, which gives a strong sense of resolution.
