### Musical scales

A scale is a set of eight notes going from one note to the same note an octave higher.

### Major scales

All major scales use the same pattern of steps:  
**Whole, Whole, Half, Whole, Whole, Whole, Half**

Notes in a major scale are named by scale degree:

1. Tonic  
2. Supertonic  
3. Mediant  
4. Subdominant  
5. Dominant  
6. Submediant  
7. Leading tone  
8. Tonic

### Minor scales

There are three minor forms:

#### Natural minor

Pattern: **Whole, Half, Whole, Whole, Half, Whole, Whole**

#### Harmonic minor

Same as natural minor but with a raised seventh.

#### Melodic minor

- Ascending: raised sixth and seventh.
- Descending: natural minor form.

### Chromatic scale

A chromatic scale uses every semitone in the octave.

### Modes

Modes start on different notes of a major scale:

- **Ionian** – major scale
- **Dorian**
- **Phrygian**
- **Lydian**
- **Mixolydian**
- **Aeolian** – natural minor
- **Locrian**
