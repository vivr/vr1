### What is Procreate?

[Procreate](https://procreate.com/) is a digital painting app for artists and illustrators primarily used with iPad. It offers a wide range of artistic tools, brushes and features. Users can work with layers, customise brushes, use advanced blending modes and export their creations in different formats.

### Gallery

When you open the Procreate app, the gallery view shows a grid of your saved projects. Tap the _+_ icon to initiate a new canvas. You can create folders to tidy up your collection. Procreate enables you to export your artworks in various formats or share them directly to social media or other apps. You can also delete projects from the gallery, aiding in storage management.

### Layers

Procreate uses a layer-based system, allowing you to work on different elements of your artwork independently. Toggling layer visibility, using solo visibility to isolate a single layer, and employing layer locks for protection are intuitive controls. The ability to merge layers, arrange their order, apply clipping masks, experiment with blend modes, enable Alpha Lock, and utilize Reference Layers adds depth and precision to your creative process.

### Drawing Guides

Drawing guides are helpful for maintaining symmetry, aligning elements, or creating specific shapes. Isometric guides help in creating drawings with a three-dimensional, isometric perspective. Perspective guides allow you to set up one, two, or three vanishing points. Symmetry guides allow you to create mirrored drawings. The Drawing Assist feature helps you create smooth, continuous lines by mirroring your strokes.

### Brushes

In Procreate, you can select from a diverse range of pre-installed brushes, adjust their settings, and utilise pressure and tilt for varied effects. Additionally, the app allows for the creation of custom brushes.

### Paint, Smudge and Erase

The Paint, Smudge, and Erase tools are essential for creating and refining digital artwork. The Paint tool is used for applying colour to the canvas, creating strokes, and adding details to your artwork. The Smudge tool simulates the effect of smearing or blending wet paint on a canvas. It's great for creating smooth transitions between colours and softening edges. The Erase tool is used to remove parts of your artwork or correct mistakes. It's essentially a brush that erases pixels on the canvas.

### Colours

Choose colours by tapping the coloured circle on the top right menu bar. Drag on the colour wheel to select a hue, then adjust brightness and saturation. You can tap and hold on the canvas to sample a colour.

### Selection Tool

The selection tool allows you to isolate specific parts of your canvas for editing, moving, or applying effects.

### Transform Tool

The transform tool allows you to resize, rotate, and distort your selected content on the canvas.

### Adjustments

Procreate provides various adjustment tools within the Adjustments menu that allow you to modify and enhance your artwork. There are a variety of adjustments and filters. Colour adjustments include Hue, saturation, and brightness, Colour balance, Curves and Gradient map. Filters include Gaussian blur, Motion blur, Perspective blur, Noise, Sharpen and more.

### Actions

The wrench icon located on the top left toolbar is the Actions menu. Here, you can make canvas adjustments, export your work, and access additional options.

### Animation

Procreate's animation feature allows users to create simple animations directly within the app. While it may not have the extensive capabilities of dedicated animation software, Procreate's animation feature is a powerful tool for creating frame-by-frame animations.

### 3D Painting

You can paint directly onto imported 3D models using .USDZ and .OBJ file formats.
