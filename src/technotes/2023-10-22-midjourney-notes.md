### What is Midjourney?

[Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/home) text-to-image AI is a technology that takes written descriptions and converts them into images.

This and other text-to-image AI technologies can be useful for various people and industries. Here are a few examples of who might benefit from it:

- Artists and creatives can use it to generate visual concepts helping them visualise ideas more easily.
- Video producers and content creators can use it to generate images and scenes for their videos.
- Educators can use it to create visual aids and illustrations for teaching materials.

### How Much Does Midjourney Cost?

The Basic Plan cost me $12 USD (Â£9.82 GBP) for one month. I'm just trying to learn about Midjourney for now so I didn't go for the annual subscription. This basic plan lets you generate up to 200 images per month. See [Midjourney pricing plans here](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/plans).

### Set Up a Discord Server

1. If you don't have a Discord account already then you can register at [discord.com](https://discord.com).
2. Once you have a Discord account you can either use it online or you can download the desktop app.
3. Click on the _'Add a Server'_ button which you can find on the left side bar.
4. Select _'Create My Own'_ from the list of options.
5. Either select _'For me and my friends'_, _'For a Club or community'_ or you can skip this question because it doesn't matter.
6. Add a server name. Call it anything you want.
7. Your new server will now appear on the left side bar. Click on it and you'll see a channel called _#general_. You can use this channel or you can create another one. You only need a text channel to use with Midjourney (not a voice channel).

### Set Up a Midjourney Account

1. Make sure you're signed into Discord either on your browser or on the desktop app.
2. Go to [midjourney.com](https://www.midjourney.com/home) and click the _'Sign In'_ button at the bottom of the page.
3. A screen will pop up from Midjourney asking for permission to set up an account through Discord. Click the _'Authorise'_ button and you'll be taken to your Midjourney account page.
4. Click on the _'Purchase Plan'_ button located around the top right side of the screen.
5. You can choose from yearly or monthly plans. As mentioned I went for the basic monthly plan just to try it out.
6. When the purchase is done you will end up back on your Midjourney account home page. Click the _'Join the Discord to start creating'_ link.
7. A screen opens inside of Discord. Click on the _'Join Midjourney'_ button.
8. A new icon appears on the Discord left side panel showing the Midjourney logo. This is the Midjourney server.

### Set Up Your Server with the Midjourney Bot

1. Near the top right of the Discord page click on the _'Show Member List'_ button. A list will appear on the right side of the screen, scroll to find the _Midjourney Bot_ in the member list.
2. Left-click on the Midjourney Bot then left-click _'Add to Server'_.
3. Left-click, _'Select Your Server'_ drop-down and choose the server you created earlier, then click '_Continue_' and _'Authorise'_. The Midjourney Bot has now been added to your server.

### Generate an Image

1. Go to your server and select one of your text channels. Type `/imagine prompt:` in the message box. _(When you type the forward slash `/` a list of commands pop up, you can choose the imagine command from this list instead of typing it)_.
2. Type a description of the picture you want Midjourney to generate then click the return key to send your message.
