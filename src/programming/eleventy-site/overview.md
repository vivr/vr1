### What This Site Is

This site is built with [Eleventy (11ty)](https://www.11ty.dev/), a static site generator that takes Markdown and Nunjucks templates and turns them into a static website. The structure is designed so new sections and posts can be added without updating configuration files.

The whole site lives inside the `src/` folder. Eleventy outputs everything into `docs/`, which is used by GitHub Pages.

### Why Eleventy?

- No complex build steps  
- Works with plain Markdown  
- Easy to customise with templates  
- Great for small, organised content sites
