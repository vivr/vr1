A decision tree is a simple model that makes choices by following a series of yes/no questions.

Think of it as a flowchart:

- start at the top  
- ask a question  
- follow the branch  
- reach a conclusion or prediction  

Decision trees are easy to understand and useful for many practical ML tasks.
