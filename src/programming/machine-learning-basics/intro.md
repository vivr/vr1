### What is Machine Learning?

Machine learning allows computers to learn from data rather than follow fixed instructions. By analysing examples, an algorithm learns patterns it can apply to new, unseen data.

ML is widely used in areas such as fraud detection, translation tools, speech recognition, recommendation systems and medical diagnosis.

The key idea is this: **give the system examples, let it learn the patterns, and use those patterns to make predictions.**

### Real-world Examples

- **Fraud detection:** spotting unusual card transactions.  
- **Search engines:** autocomplete suggestions and ranking pages.  
- **Recommendation systems:** choosing films or products you might like.  
- **Speech and image recognition:** voice assistants, medical imaging, autonomous vehicles.
