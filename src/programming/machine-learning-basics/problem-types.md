Machine learning problems generally fall into two groups: **supervised learning** and **unsupervised learning**.

### Supervised Learning

In supervised learning, you have input data and target labels. The goal is to learn the relationship between them.

Two common tasks:

- **Classification:** predicting a category. Example: deciding whether a fruit is an apple or a banana based on colour and shape.
- **Regression:** predicting a number. Example: estimating house prices based on features such as square footage.

### Unsupervised Learning

Here, the data has **no labels**. The aim is to find useful structure.

Common tasks include:

- **Clustering:** grouping similar items, e.g. customer segments.  
- **Anomaly detection:** spotting unusual behaviour or errors.  
- **Dimensionality reduction:** reducing the number of features while keeping the important patterns. **(PCA)** is a common technique that finds the main directions of variation in the data and uses them to create a smaller, cleaner set of features.
