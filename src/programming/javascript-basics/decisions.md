### Decisions

A decision is typically implemented using conditional statements. These statements allow your code to make decisions based on certain conditions. The most common ones are `if` and `else`. They enable your program to execute different blocks of code depending on whether a specified condition evaluates to true or false.

The `if` statement takes a condition as its argument, and if the condition is true, then the block of code following the `if` statement is executed. The `else` statement is used to specify code that should be executed if the condition in the `if` statement is false.
