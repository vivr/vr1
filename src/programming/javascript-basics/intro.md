### What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a programming language that makes web pages interactive. It lets you respond to user actions, update content on the page and control how things behave in the browser.

### Where JavaScript Runs

JavaScript can run:

- **In the browser**, to update web pages.
- **On a server**, using platforms such as Node.js.

This means you can use one language across the whole stack.
