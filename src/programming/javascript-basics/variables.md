### Variables

Variables are used to store and manage data. You can think of a variable as a named container that holds a value. This value can be a number, string, object, or any other data type. Variables provide a way to store information in your program and reference it later. When we declare a variable it looks like this: `var name = viv;`.

In Javascript, `const` is a keyword used to declare a constant variable. Once a variable is defined with `const`, its value cannot be reassigned. However, it's important to note that `const` does not make the variable itself immutable; it only prevents reassignment of the variable reference. Use `const` when you want to ensure that a variable's value remains constant throughout its scope.
