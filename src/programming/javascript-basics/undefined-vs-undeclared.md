### Undefined vs Undeclared

**Undefined** is a value that a declared variable or function can have when it has not been assigned a value or has no explicit return value.

**Undeclared** refers to using a variable that has not been declared using `var`, `let`, or `const`, and it can lead to different behaviors depending on whether you are in strict mode or not. In strict mode, it results in a reference error, and in non-strict mode, it creates a global variable.
