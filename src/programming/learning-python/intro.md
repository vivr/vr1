### What is Python?

Python is a popular programming language that's easy to learn. It's used for many things like artificial intelligence, data science, and web development. You might not realise it, but YouTube and Netflix use Python behind the scenes. The best part? It's completely free and open-source.

However, Python does run slower than some other languages like C++ or Rust because Python reads your code line-by-line as it runs (it's an "interpreted" language), whilst those languages prepare everything first (they're "compiled" languages). If you need super-fast programs, like video games, you might want to use a compiled language instead. But for most things, Python is fast enough and much easier to learn.
